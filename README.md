social media is a rich platform for websites and applications that focus on communication, 
community-based input, interaction, content sharing, and collaboration. Most people use social 
media to stay in touch. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is the main stock exchange in Sri 
Lanka. It utilizes an electronic trading platform. In the modern world, social media users use posts 
to share their thoughts with others. Those posts can have a huge impact on stock prices. It will be 
crashing stock prices or increased hype for increased stock prices. Stock price movements are 
determined by supply and demand, and emotions play a key role in determining supply and 
demand. Emotions, on the other hand, are influenced by social media. The purpose of this study is 
to analyze the Twitter posts on stock prices at the CSE. Twitter is a popular social media platform 
with a large user base. This paper examines sentiment analysis, which is an approach to natural 
language processing (NLP) that detects the emotion of Twitter posts. According to the sentiment 
of those Twitter posts, we find out how the price of a share changes and provides signals for 
treceivetors. We describe the method of data collection, methods of analysis, and machine learning 
technique that we performed, and also discuss the impact of Twitter posts on stock prices at the 
CSE
